# cardTokenizer

An android app developed completely in React Native and the backend developed in Djange with a functionality of saving users' Credit/Debit Cards details in an Encrypted manner in form of tokens.
This tokenized card containing all the card details may be then directly used at Payment Gateways and the bank with the token key can directly decrypt the card details and do successful transactions.

This app makes the payment path secure so that there is no data breach happening in between a payment.

The app's frontend worked completely but now since the backend is not anymore hosted, the frontend being connected may not repond properly. You may try using this app by removing the backend links...
